I am the Chief Technology Officer @ Hooli Corp.

Gentoo and Arch are my daily drivers. Vim is my preferred editor. Golang, Java, C# and Ruby are the languages I speak.

My favorite novels are [The Blue Nowhere](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/343995.The_Blue_Nowhere) and [Project Hail Mary](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54493401-project-hail-mary). Another book I loved and find worth mentioning is [How to Invent Everything](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39026990-how-to-invent-everything?ref=nav_sb_ss_1_18).

Some of my favorite movies are [The Man From Earth](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0756683/), and the whole [Back to the Future](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088763/) series.
