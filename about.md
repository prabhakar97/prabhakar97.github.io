I am a software engineer who loves building and scaling big systems from scratch using modern technologies. I am good at architecting, designing and implementing
backend infrastructure (workflows, services, asynchrony) with Java, Ruby, Javascript and C#. I have a solid background in Computer
Science, in part due to my masters degree from IIT Madras and rest of it due to my passion in computers since childhood.

I am a fan of Arch Linux as my OS, vim as my editor and prefer it for everything non-java. For Java, I use IntelliJ Idea which is an amazing IDE.

I am a fan of the novel [The Blue Nowhere](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0671042262) by Jeffrey Deaver.
I have recently read [Sapiens](https://www.amazon.in/Sapiens-Humankind-Yuval-Noah-Harari/dp/0062316095) and my mind was blown by the ideas communicated elegantly
by the author [Yuval Noah Harari](https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/395812.Yuval_Noah_Harari).

Some of my favorite movies are [The Man From Earth](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0756683/), [Interstellar](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/) and [Back to the Future](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088763/).
